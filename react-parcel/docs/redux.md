# Redux

Redux is an immutable (predictable) state container. It creates a global javascript value to store state. It mutates state by appending new values of the state, rather than mutating the object directly.

I like it because it's motivated by functional programming concepts, which encourages immutability. I've also found it to be the best scalable state container for web, avoiding spaghetti.
