        Whenever I can, I'll choose functional inspired styles. Redux, functional components and anything that promotes
        immutability and limits side effects. The only negative of Redux has been mostly removed, the amount of plumbing
        has been reduced by toolkits & framework features such as hooks. I also prefer zero-config (parcel) build tools.
        Finally I've just never seen anything really challenging bootstrap when it comes to productivity. Bootstrap
        stays out of your way, unlike Tailwind or Material which just feels too pushy for me. I also prefer domain or
        feature driven structures, hence I'll split code according to features, not function. feature/users instead of
        reducers/, components/ etc. I feel this scales better.
