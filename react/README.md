## Opinions

Whenever I can, I'll choose functional inspired styles. Redux, functional components and anything that promotes immutability and limits side effects. The only negative of Redux has been mostly removed, the amount of plumbing has been reduced by toolkits & framework features such as hooks. I also prefer zero-config (parcel) build tools. Finally I've just never seen anything really challenging bootstrap when it comes to productivity. Bootstrap stays out of your way, unlike Tailwind or Material which just feels too pushy for me. I also prefer domain or feature driven structures, hence I'll split code according to features, not function. feature/users instead of reducers/, components/ etc. I feel this scales better.
